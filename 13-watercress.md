# Chapter 13: Watercress (*Nasturtium officinale*)

## The Peppery Stream Green

Watercress is the forager's gift from flowing water—a peppery, nutritious green that grows abundantly in cold, clean streams and springs throughout the Pacific Northwest. Unlike many wild foods that require hiking into remote areas, watercress often grows right along accessible creeks in parks, trails, and even urban waterways.

This aquatic green has been cultivated and foraged for thousands of years, prized for its distinctive peppery bite, exceptional nutrition, and year-round availability. In fact, watercress is one of the few wild greens you can harvest in every season, making it an invaluable addition to any forager's repertoire.

## Identification: The Aquatic Herb

Watercress grows directly in water, which already narrows down identification considerably.

### Key Identifying Characteristics

**Growth Habit:**
- **Aquatic/semi-aquatic plant** growing in shallow water
- **Grows IN streams, springs, and flowing water** (not on banks)
- Forms dense, floating or partially submerged mats
- Stems float and root in the stream bed
- **Prefers cold, clean, moving water** (not stagnant ponds)

**Stems:**
- **Hollow, succulent stems**
- Pale green to white
- Floating or partially submerged
- Roots form at nodes (where leaves attach)
- 4-12 inches long, branching

**Leaves:**
- **Compound leaves with 3-9 leaflets**
- Terminal (end) leaflet is largest
- Leaflets are **rounded with smooth or slightly wavy edges**
- **Dark green color**
- Shiny, smooth surface
- Arranged alternately on stems
- **Taste: Peppery, sharp, mustard-like** (this is a key identifier!)

**Flowers:**
- **Small white flowers** with 4 petals
- 1/8 inch across
- Clustered at stem tips
- Bloom spring through summer
- Cross-shaped (characteristic of mustard family)

**Seeds/Seed Pods:**
- **Long, thin seed pods** (siliques)
- 1/2 to 1 inch long
- Point upward
- Appear after flowering

**Roots:**
- **White, fibrous roots** emerging from stem nodes
- Roots anchor plant to stream bed

**Smell & Taste:**
- **Peppery, mustard-like aroma** when crushed
- **Sharp, peppery taste** similar to arugula or radish
- This is one of the best identifiers!

## Look-Alikes & Safety Concerns

### Fool's Watercress (*Apium nodiflorum*)

An edible look-alike that grows in similar habitat:

**Differences:**
- Leaves are more finely divided
- Less peppery taste
- **Also edible** (though less flavorful)
- Hard to distinguish without experience

### Water Hemlock (*Cicuta* species) - DEADLY POISONOUS

**THIS IS THE CRITICAL CONCERN!**

Water hemlock is one of North America's most poisonous plants and grows in similar habitats.

**How to Distinguish:**
- Water hemlock grows **ON BANKS**, not floating in water
- **Larger plant** (3-6 feet tall) - watercress is smaller
- **Compound leaves but leaflets are sharply serrated** (not rounded like watercress)
- **White umbrella-shaped flower clusters** (umbels) - not individual 4-petaled flowers
- **Smells unpleasant** when crushed (not peppery-pleasant)
- **Hollow stems with purple streaks or mottling**
- **Thick taproot often with chambered structure** (if you see the root)

**NEVER harvest watercress from plants growing on muddy banks—only from floating mats IN the water!**

### Poison Hemlock (*Conium maculatum*) - DEADLY POISONOUS

Another deadly plant:

**How to Distinguish:**
- Grows on dry land or moist banks (not IN water)
- **Much larger** (3-10 feet tall)
- **Purple spots on stems**
- **Fern-like leaves** (finely divided)
- **Umbrella-shaped white flowers**
- **Smells like mouse urine** when crushed (seriously)

### SAFETY RULES:

1. **Only harvest watercress growing IN flowing water** (floating mats or partially submerged)
2. **Never harvest from muddy banks** where hemlock species might be confused
3. **Taste test**: Watercress is pleasantly peppery; hemlocks taste terrible
4. **Learn hemlock identification** before you forage watercress
5. **When in doubt, don't harvest**

## Season & Habitat

### When to Forage

**Year-Round Availability!**

Watercress is unique among the greens in this book—you can harvest it any time:

- **Spring**: Most tender, abundant, flavorful
- **Summer**: Good, but may get tough in hot weather
- **Fall**: Excellent again as weather cools
- **Winter**: Still harvestable in mild PNW winters (though growth slows)

**Best seasons:**
- **Spring (March-May)**: Peak tenderness and flavor
- **Fall (September-November)**: Second-best season

**Avoid:**
- **During flowering/seeding**: Can be bitter, tougher
- **Hot summer**: May be too peppery or tough

### Where It Grows

Watercress has specific habitat requirements:

**Water Requirements:**
- **Cold, clean, flowing water** (not stagnant)
- Springs and spring-fed streams
- Clear creeks and brooks
- **Prefers water temperatures 50-68°F**
- Shallow water (a few inches to a foot deep)
- Moderate current (not rapids, not still)

**Water Quality:**
- **Clean water is essential** (watercress bioaccumulates pollutants)
- Avoid downstream from agriculture, industry, or roads
- Look for clear, clean streams
- Presence of trout is a good sign (they like clean water too)

**Habitat:**
- Shaded to partially sunny locations
- Low elevations (usually below 3,000 feet)
- Temperate areas (common west of Cascades)
- Areas with year-round water flow

**Specific Locations:**
- Spring heads and seeps
- Small forest streams
- Park creeks and waterways
- Agricultural ditches (IF clean and not sprayed)

## Specific Foraging Locations

### Washington

**Puget Sound Lowlands:**
- Urban park streams (if clean)
- Seward Park, Seattle (check creek)
- Green River tributaries
- Small streams in parks throughout the region

**Olympic Peninsula:**
- Spring-fed streams in Olympic National Forest
- Low-elevation forest creeks
- Abundant in many locations

**Southwest Washington:**
- Streams near Longview/Kelso area
- Lewis River tributaries
- Spring-fed creeks

### Oregon

**Willamette Valley:**
- Numerous small streams and springs
- Portland area park creeks (if clean)
- Rural areas with spring-fed creeks

**Coast:**
- Coastal streams (check water quality—avoid runoff areas)
- Spring heads in Coast Range

**Columbia River Gorge:**
- Tributaries on both sides
- Spring-fed creeks

### Urban Foraging

Watercress can be found in urban streams, BUT:

**Critical safety considerations:**
- **Water quality is paramount**
- Avoid streams downstream from:
  - Industrial areas
  - Heavy traffic roads
  - Agricultural runoff
  - Wastewater treatment plants
- Look for spring-fed urban creeks with clean, clear water
- When in doubt, skip urban watercress

## Health Risks: Liver Flukes

**Important Safety Warning:**

Watercress can harbor **liver flukes** (*Fasciola hepatica*)—parasitic flatworms transmitted from sheep and cattle:

### What Are Liver Flukes?

- Parasites that infect the liver
- Eggs are shed in animal feces
- Contaminate water
- Attach to watercress
- Can infect humans who eat contaminated watercress

### Symptoms of Infection:

- Abdominal pain
- Nausea
- Fever
- Can cause serious liver damage if untreated

### Prevention:

**NEVER eat wild watercress raw unless you're certain of water quality!**

**Safe preparation methods:**

1. **Cook thoroughly**: Heat kills liver fluke larvae
   - Boil, sauté, or steam
   - This is the safest method

2. **Soak in vinegar solution**: Some sources suggest soaking for 10-15 minutes
   - Not as reliable as cooking
   - Not recommended as sole method

3. **Harvest from clean, livestock-free watersheds**:
   - Spring heads above any agricultural activity
   - Areas with no livestock access upstream
   - Clean, protected watersheds

**For most foragers: Cook your watercress. It's delicious cooked and eliminates risk.**

## Harvesting Tips

### How to Harvest

**Cut, Don't Pull:**
- Use scissors or knife
- **Cut stems above the roots** (leave roots in place)
- Take the tender top 3-6 inches of stems
- Leave lower, tougher portions
- Plant will regrow from remaining stems and roots

**Selective Harvesting:**
- Don't strip an entire patch
- Take from multiple plants
- Leave plenty to regenerate

**Best Stage:**
- **Young, tender growth** (before flowering)
- Bright green, crisp leaves
- Avoid yellowing or damaged leaves

**Avoid:**
- Tough, woody stems
- Flowering or seeding plants (can be bitter)
- Plants in stagnant or polluted water

### Cleaning

Watercress requires thorough cleaning:

1. **Rinse multiple times** in cold water
2. **Soak in clean water** for 10 minutes
3. **Inspect for aquatic insects or debris**
4. **Spin dry** or pat dry with towels
5. **Cook before eating** (safest method)
