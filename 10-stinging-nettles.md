# Chapter 10: Stinging Nettles (*Urtica dioica*)

## The Spiky Spring Superfood

Stinging nettles have a special place in foraging lore: they're the plant that fights back! Touch them with bare skin and you'll experience an immediate burning, stinging sensation that can last for hours. Yet despite (or perhaps because of) this defensive strategy, nettles are among the most nutritious wild foods you can harvest—packed with vitamins, minerals, and protein that rival any cultivated green.

The beauty of nettles is their fool proof identification: if it stings you, it's nettles! And once you learn to harvest them safely, you'll discover a versatile spring green that tastes like the best spinach you've ever eaten.

## Identification: The Plant That Announces Itself

Stinging nettles practically identify themselves by stinging you—but let's learn to recognize them before that happens!

### Key Identifying Characteristics

**Overall Appearance:**
- **Upright herbaceous plant** 2-6 feet tall (occasionally taller)
- Grows in dense patches from spreading rhizomes
- Square stems (run your gloved finger along it—it has 4 sides)
- Bright green color

**Leaves:**
- **Opposite arrangement** (pairs of leaves across from each other on stem)
- **Heart-shaped to lance-shaped** with pointed tips
- **Coarsely toothed edges** (serrated)
- 2-5 inches long
- Prominently veined
- **Covered in fine, hollow hairs** (these are the stinging needles!)

**Stinging Hairs:**
- **The signature feature!**
- Fine, needle-like hairs covering stems and leaves
- **Hollow** (like hypodermic needles)
- Contain histamine, acetylcholine, and formic acid
- Break off when touched, injecting these compounds into skin
- Cause immediate burning, stinging, itching sensation

**Flowers:**
- Small, green, hanging clusters
- Inconspicuous (not showy)
- Appear in late spring/early summer
- **Don't harvest once flowering begins** (leaves become gritty with calcium crystals)

**Roots:**
- Yellow, spreading rhizomes
- This is how nettles colonize areas
- We don't harvest roots for food (though they have medicinal use)

**Growth Pattern:**
- Forms dense stands via rhizomes
- Often hundreds of plants growing together
- Returns to same locations year after year

## Look-Alikes: The Sting Tells All

**The foolproof identification method: Touch it with a gloved hand or the back of your hand (less sensitive). If it stings, it's nettles!**

### Potential Confusion Plants

**Dead Nettle** (*Lamium* species):
- Similar toothed leaves
- **No stinging hairs** (hence "dead" nettle)
- **Purple or white flowers** (showy, unlike nettles)
- Also edible (but not as nutritious)
- Smaller plant overall

**Hemp Nettle** (*Galeopsis tetrahit*):
- Square stem like nettles
- **No stinging hairs**
- Different leaf shape
- Not particularly good to eat

**Wood Nettle** (*Laportea canadensis*):
- Related species with stinging hairs
- Alternate leaves (not opposite)
- Also edible
- Less common in PNW

**Bottom line:**
- If it has opposite leaves, serrated edges, and **stings you**, it's stinging nettle
- If it looks like nettle but doesn't sting, it's probably something else (and likely edible anyway)

## Season & Habitat

### When to Forage

**Prime Season: March-May** (early spring)

**Harvest Timeline:**
- **Early spring (March-April)**: Best time! Young, tender shoots
- **Mid-spring (May)**: Still good, plants 1-3 feet tall
- **Late spring (June)**: Okay, but getting tough
- **Once flowering begins**: **STOP**—leaves develop gritty calcium crystals

**What to Harvest:**
- **Young plants** (6-12 inches tall): Harvest entire plant (cut at ground level)
- **Larger plants**: Harvest top 4-6 inches (tender growing tip)
- **Spring only**: Don't harvest in summer/fall (too fibrous, not nutritious)

### Where They Grow

Nettles love disturbed, nitrogen-rich soil:

**Preferred Habitat:**
- **Riparian zones** along streams, creeks, rivers (most common)
- Rich, moist soil
- Edges of forests and clearings
- Disturbed areas (old homesteads, logged areas)
- Bottomlands and floodplains
- Ditches and drainage areas
- **Anywhere with high soil nitrogen**

**Indicators of Good Nettle Habitat:**
- Moist soil with water nearby
- Rich, dark soil (often near decomposing organic matter)
- Partial sun to shade
- Other nitrogen-loving plants (dock, elderberry, cow parsnip)

**Elevation:**
- Sea level to mid-elevations (up to 4,000 feet)
- More abundant in lowlands

## Specific Foraging Locations

### Washington

**Puget Sound Lowlands:**
- Urban greenspaces and stream corridors
- Discovery Park, Seattle
- Green River Trail
- Nisqually River delta
- Any stream or wetland edge

**Olympic Peninsula:**
- Riparian areas along trails
- Hoh, Queets, and Quinault River valleys
- Lowland forests

**Cascade Foothills:**
- Stream crossings on forest trails
- Old homesteads and logging camps
- Riparian zones in Mount Baker-Snoqualmie NF

### Oregon

**Willamette Valley:**
- Along the Willamette River and tributaries
- Forest Park, Portland (stream crossings)
- Rural areas and farm edges
- Silver Falls State Park riparian zones

**Coast:**
- Stream corridors throughout Coast Range
- Riparian areas on coastal trails

**Columbia River Gorge:**
- Trails with streams (Eagle Creek, etc.)
- Both Washington and Oregon sides

### Urban Foraging

Nettles are **excellent for urban foraging**:

- Common in city parks with streams
- Greenways and urban trails
- Often prolific in neglected lots
- Along drainage ditches

**Urban Safety:**
- Avoid areas sprayed with herbicides
- Don't pick near busy roads (heavy metals in soil)
- Watch for dog waste contamination
- Wash thoroughly before cooking

## Harvesting Tips: Avoiding the Sting!

### Essential Gear

**Gloves** (Absolutely Required!):
- **Thick gloves** (leather, rubber, or thick gardening gloves)
- Thin latex gloves won't work—the hairs pierce through!
- Bring extra gloves in case one tears

**Additional Gear:**
- Scissors or knife
- Bag or basket
- Long sleeves and pants recommended

### Harvesting Technique

**Early Season (Small Plants):**
- Wearing gloves, grasp plant near base
- Cut at ground level with scissors
- Place in bag
- Entire young plant is tender and edible

**Mid-Season (Larger Plants):**
- Cut top 4-6 inches (the tender growing tip)
- Leave lower, tougher portions
- Cut with scissors rather than pulling

**Safety:**
- **Always wear gloves!** (Worth repeating!)
- Be careful when reaching through nettles to cut
- Watch where you step—nettles often grow in dense patches
- Don't let harvested nettles touch bare skin (they still sting!)

### Sustainable Harvesting

- Nettles are very common and regenerate quickly—moderate harvesting is fine
- Cut rather than pull (pulling can damage rhizomes)
- Leave some plants for wildlife and to ensure next year's growth
- Return to the same productive patches year after year

## Handling Raw Nettles

**They can still sting after harvest!**

- Handle with gloves until cooked
- Don't let them touch bare skin during washing
- Be careful during processing

**Neutralizing the Sting:**

Cooking (boiling, steaming, sautéing) completely destroys the stinging compounds. Cooked nettles are absolutely safe to handle and eat.

**Alternatively:**
- Drying neutralizes the sting
- Blending fresh nettles (for soup or pesto) breaks the hairs
- Wilting/crushing the leaves disables the stinging hairs

## What If You Get Stung?

It happens to everyone eventually!

**Immediate Reaction:**
- Burning, stinging, itching sensation
- Small white bumps may appear
- Can last 30 minutes to several hours

**Treatment:**
- **Don't scratch or rub!** This drives the hairs deeper
- Use tape to pull out remaining hairs
- **Jewelweed** (if growing nearby) can soothe—crush and apply juice
- **Dock leaves** (often grow near nettles)—crush and apply
- Baking soda paste
- Cold water rinse
- Antihistamine cream or oral antihistamine for severe reactions

**The good news:** The sting is temporary and not dangerous (unless you're allergic, which is extremely rare).

## Culinary Uses

### Flavor Profile

Cooked nettles taste like **the best spinach you've ever eaten**:
- Rich, green, earthy flavor

## Tips for Success

1. **Harvest early**: March-April for best tenderness
2. **Good gloves are essential**: Don't skimp!
3. **Find reliable patches**: Return to same spots each year
4. **Look near water**: Streams and wet areas are best
5. **Stop harvesting when flowering begins**: Leaves get gritty
6. **Cooking neutralizes sting**: Don't be afraid once they're cooked
7. **Try the tea**: Dried nettle tea is a daily health tonic
8. **Freeze for later**: Enjoy nettles year-round

## Fun Facts

- Nettle fiber is stronger than cotton and was used for cloth and rope
- Roman soldiers reportedly stung themselves with nettles to stay warm in cold Britain
