## 🚨 Critical Safety Information

### ⚠️ The 100% Rule

**NEVER eat anything you cannot identify with 100% certainty.**

When in doubt, throw it out. No meal is worth risking your health.

### 🍄 Mushroom Safety

The Pacific Northwest has several **deadly poisonous mushrooms**, including:
- **Death Cap** (*Amanita phalloides*)
- **Destroying Angel** (*Amanita ocreata*)
- **Deadly Galerina** (*Galerina marginata*)

Always use multiple identification features. Never rely on a single characteristic or photo identification alone.

### 🌿 Plant Safety

Some plants covered in this book require special handling or preparation:
- **Stinging nettles**: Wear gloves! Cooking neutralizes the sting.
- **Fiddlehead ferns**: MUST be cooked thoroughly (never eat raw).
- **Watercress**: Risk of liver flukes—cook unless certain of water quality.
- **Wood sorrel**: Contains oxalic acid—use in moderation.

### 📜 Legal & Ethical Foraging

- **Check regulations** before harvesting (National Parks, National Forests, State Parks all have different rules)
- **Get required permits** (some areas require free personal-use permits)
- **Respect private property** (always get permission)
- **Harvest sustainably** (take only what you need, leave plenty behind)
- **Leave no trace** (respect the environment and other users)
