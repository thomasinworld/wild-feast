## Creating Your Own Foraging Map

### Using Google My Maps

You can create your own custom foraging map:

1. Go to [Google My Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/d/)
2. Click "Create a New Map"
3. Add markers for your discoveries:
   - 🍄 Red pins: Mushroom spots
   - 🫐 Blue pins: Berry patches
   - 🌿 Green pins: Wild greens
4. Add notes about:
   - Date found
   - Abundance
   - Best access route
   - Seasonal notes

### Privacy Note

**Keep your best spots secret!** Many foragers maintain private maps of their productive patches. Consider:
- Not sharing exact GPS coordinates publicly
- Sharing general areas instead ("Mount Rainier area" vs. specific GPS)
- Building your own library of spots over years
