## Land Acknowledgment

The lands described in this book—the Pacific Northwest territories of Washington and Oregon—are the traditional and ancestral homelands of numerous indigenous peoples, including but not limited to:

- **Coast Salish peoples** (Duwamish, Suquamish, Snoqualmie, Tulalip, Stillaguamish, and many others)
- **Chinook peoples**
- **Tillamook peoples**
- **Kalapuya peoples**
- **Nez Perce**
- **Yakama Nation**
- **Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde**
- **Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians**
- And many others

These indigenous communities have been stewards of these lands and have sustainably harvested wild foods for thousands of years. Their traditional ecological knowledge far exceeds what is presented in this book. We acknowledge their deep connection to these lands and the wild foods that grow here.

## Author's Note on Sources

This book was compiled through extensive web research and synthesis of publicly available information about Pacific Northwest foraging. While every effort has been made to ensure accuracy, readers should:

1. **Cross-reference information** with multiple sources
2. **Invest in quality field guides** specific to the region
3. **Join local foraging groups** and learn from experienced foragers
4. **Never eat anything unless 100% certain of identification**
5. **Understand that foraging carries inherent risks**

The author and sources listed here are not liable for misidentification, illness, or injury resulting from foraging activities. Foraging is undertaken at your own risk.

## Updates and Corrections

Mycology and botanical knowledge evolve. Species names change, new research emerges, and our understanding deepens. If you notice errors or have suggestions for improvement, please contribute to the ongoing knowledge of Pacific Northwest foraging by sharing with local mycological societies and botanical organizations.
