# Chapter 8: Blackberries & Thimbleberries

## The Accessible Brambles

If huckleberries are the mountain treasure requiring pilgrimage, blackberries and thimbleberries are the generous gifts found along every trail, roadside, and forest edge in the Pacific Northwest. These brambles offer abundant, delicious berries that require no special trip—you'll encounter them on your regular hikes, walks, and even in urban parks.

While purists may scoff at the invasive Himalayan blackberry, there's no denying the joy of sun-warmed blackberries picked straight from the vine on a late-August hike. And thimbleberries, the blackberry's native cousin, offer delicate sweetness to those who know where to look.

## Blackberries: The Invasive Delicacy

### Species Overview

**Himalayan Blackberry** (*Rubus armeniacus*):
- **Non-native invasive** from Armenia (not actually from the Himalayas)
- Introduced in the late 1800s
- Now dominates disturbed areas throughout western WA and OR
- Incredibly aggressive and thorny
- Produces abundant, delicious berries

**Trailing Blackberry / Dewberry** (*Rubus ursinus*):
- **Native species**
- Much less common than Himalayan blackberry
- Smaller berries
- Less aggressive growth
- Equally edible and delicious

### Identification: Himalayan Blackberry

**Growth Habit:**
- **Extremely aggressive, sprawling canes** that can grow 20-40 feet long
- Forms impenetrable thickets
- Arching canes that root where they touch the ground
- **Viciously thorny** (seriously—wear protection!)

**Stems/Canes:**
- Thick, ridged, angular canes
- **Large, sharp, curved thorns** (this is the defining feature)
- Green when young, becoming woody and brown
- Biennial fruiting (canes grow year 1, fruit year 2, then die)

**Leaves:**
- **Compound leaves with 5 leaflets** (sometimes 3)
- Each leaflet is 2-4 inches long
- Sharply toothed edges
- Dark green on top, paler underneath (sometimes whitish)
- **Underside may be slightly fuzzy**

**Flowers:**
- **White to pale pink, 5 petals**
- 1 inch across
- Bloom May-July
- Clustered at branch ends
- Attractive and showy

**Berries:**
- **Large** (up to 3/4 inch long)
- **Composite drupes** (made of many small segments)
- **Color progression**: green → red → dark purple-black when ripe
- **Ripen July-September** (peak: August)
- Sweet-tart flavor when fully ripe
- Stay attached to white core when picked (unlike raspberries)

### Identification: Native Trailing Blackberry

**Growth Habit:**
- Low, trailing vines (not upright arching canes)
- Much less aggressive than Himalayan
- Found in forest understory and edges

**Differences from Himalayan:**
- **3 leaflets** (not 5)
- Smaller, less aggressive thorns
- **Smaller berries** (but excellent flavor)
- More shade-tolerant
- Often overlooked due to Himalayan dominance

**Both species are fully edible and delicious!**

## Thimbleberries: The Native Treat

### Identification

**Growth Habit:**
- Upright shrub, 3-8 feet tall
- Forms patches via rhizomes (underground runners)
- **No thorns or prickles whatsoever!** (This is key)
- Found in partial shade along forest edges and trails

**Leaves:**
- **Large, maple-like leaves** (5-7 lobed)
- 4-8 inches across
- Bright green, slightly fuzzy
- **Very distinctive** (can't be mistaken for anything poisonous)

**Flowers:**
- **Pure white, 5 petals**
- 1-2 inches across
- Crinkled, papery petals
- Bloom late April-June
- Beautiful and showy

**Berries:**
- **Bright red when ripe**
- **Thimble-shaped** (hence the name)
- Soft, delicate, hollow (like raspberries)
- **Come off the white core easily when picked**
- 1/2-3/4 inch wide
- **Ripen June-August** (earlier than blackberries)
- Many small drupelets, large seeds
- Delicate, sweet, slightly tart flavor

**Stems:**
- Smooth bark, no thorns
- Brown to reddish-brown
- Shreddy bark on older canes

## Look-Alikes: All Edible

The great news: **All *Rubus* species (brambles) in the Pacific Northwest are edible.** The worst mistake you can make is picking a different kind of edible berry.

### Raspberries (*Rubus idaeus*)

Wild red raspberries grow throughout the PNW:

**Similarities to blackberries:**
- Compound leaves
- Thorny canes
- Berry structure

**Differences:**
- **Always red** (not purple-black)
- **Hollow** (comes off the white core like thimbleberries)
- Smaller berries than Himalayan blackberry
- More shade-tolerant

**Also delicious and edible!**

### Salmonberries (*Rubus spectabilis*)

Covered in Chapter 6, but worth mentioning:

**Differences:**
- **Salmon/orange/yellow color** (never dark purple)
- **Flowers are bright magenta** (not white)
- Ripen much earlier (May-July)
- Found near water

**Also edible!**

## Season & Habitat

### Blackberries

**Flowering**: May-July
**Fruiting**: July-September (peak: August)

**Where they grow:**
- **Disturbed areas** (roadsides, edges, clearcuts)
- Urban and suburban areas
- Abandoned lots and fencelines
- Forest edges and trails
- Riparian zones
- **Full sun to partial shade**
- **Himalayan blackberry prefers sun**; native trailing blackberry tolerates more shade

**Elevation:**
- Mostly low elevations (sea level to 2,000 feet)
- Rare in mountains

**Invasiveness:**
Himalayan blackberry is a serious ecological problem:
- Outcompetes native plants
- Forms monocultures
- Difficult to eradicate
- **Ethical foraging**: Picking berries doesn't spread them, but be aware of the impact
- Some argue foraging helps "justify" the invasion, others say you might as well enjoy the berries since they're here

### Thimbleberries

**Flowering**: Late April-June
**Fruiting**: June-August

**Where they grow:**
- **Forest edges and openings**
- Partial shade (more shade-tolerant than blackberries)
- Trails and clearings in coastal and mountain forests
- Alongside roads through forests
- Riparian areas
- **Not in full sun (unlike blackberries)**

**Elevation:**
- Sea level to mid-elevations (up to 4,000 feet)
- Common in Coast Range and west-side Cascades

## Specific Foraging Locations

## Harvesting Tips

### Blackberries

**Protective Gear:**
- **Long sleeves and pants** (those thorns are serious!)
- **Gloves** (leather or thick gardening gloves)
- **Closed-toe shoes** (preferably boots)
- Consider eye protection (branches snap back)

**Picking Technique:**
- **Only pick fully ripe berries**: Deep purple-black, not red
- **Taste test**: Ripe berries are sweet; underripe are tart/sour
- **Gentle pull**: Ripe berries come off easily with gentle tug
- **Watch for thorns** on all sides
- Use a container with a handle (bucket or berry-picking container)

**Safety Considerations:**
- **Urban areas**: Avoid roadsides (exhaust fumes, herbicides)
- **Check for spraying**: Don't pick near recently maintained roadsides or utility corridors
- **Watch for bees and wasps**: They love blackberries too!
- **Bring first aid**: Those thorns will get you eventually

**Timing:**
- **Morning**: Berries are firmest and coolest
- **After a few sunny days**: Sweetest berries
- **Avoid picking after rain**: Waterlogged berries

### Thimbleberries

**Gentle Handling:**
- **VERY delicate**: Thimbleberries are the most fragile berries in this book
- Pick directly into a flat container
- **Don't stack them**: They crush immediately
- Line container with paper towels

**Picking Technique:**
- **Touch test**: Ripe berries fall into your hand with the slightest touch
- **Color check**: Bright red (not orange or dark red)
- **Don't pull**: If it resists, it's not ready
- **Pick over multiple visits**: They ripen continuously

**Reality Check:**
- You won't get buckets of thimbleberries
- **Enjoy them on the trail**: They don't transport or store well
- **Pick a small amount for a special treat**: Realistic goal is a pint or less per outing
- Focus on the experience, not quantity

## Cultural & Ecological Notes

### Himalayan Blackberry: The Invader

**Ecological Impact:**
- Displaces native plants
- Reduces wildlife habitat diversity
- Difficult to eradicate (even cutting spreads it)
- Forms monocultures

**The Foraging Dilemma:**
- Picking berries doesn't spread the plant
- But does it make us complicit in accepting the invasion?
- Pragmatic view: They're here, they're not going away, might as well enjoy the berries
- Activist view: Don't celebrate invasive species

**You decide your own ethics on this one.**

### Thimbleberries: Native Heritage

- Indigenous peoples have harvested thimbleberries for millennia
- Used fresh, dried, and made into cakes for winter storage
- Leaves were used medicinally
- Important wildlife food (bears, birds, small mammals)

## Tips for Success

**Blackberries:**
1. **Dress for battle**: Long sleeves, gloves, boots
2. **Taste as you go**: Ripeness varies greatly
3. **Avoid roadsides**: Exhaust and herbicides
4. **Check the back**: Best berries are often hidden behind the thorns
5. **Bring a stick**: Push branches aside safely

**Thimbleberries:**
1. **Lower your expectations**: You won't fill buckets
2. **Enjoy the moment**: Eat them on the trail
3. **Gentle touch**: They'll fall into your hand when ready
4. **Look in shade**: Not in full sun like blackberries
5. **No thorns**: You can pick in shorts and t-shirt!

## Fun Facts

- Himalayan blackberry was introduced by Luther Burbank in 1885 as a cultivated crop—oops!
