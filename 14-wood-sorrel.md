# Chapter 14: Wood Sorrel (*Oxalis* species)

## The Lemony Forest Gem

Wood sorrel is nature's answer to sour candy—a delicate, clover-like plant with an intensely tart, lemony flavor that delights foragers and surprises first-timers. This humble groundcover is so common it's often overlooked or dismissed as a weed, yet it's been used as food and medicine for centuries, and once you taste it, you'll never walk past it again without nibbling a leaf.

What makes wood sorrel special isn't just its accessibility (it grows everywhere from deep forests to garden beds) or its distinctive appearance, but its remarkable flavor—sharp, citrusy, refreshing, and completely unique. It's trail candy, a natural lemonade ingredient, and a zesty addition to salads all in one tiny plant.

## Identification: The False Clover

Wood sorrel is sometimes called "false shamrock" because of its three-parted leaves that resemble clover—but it's not related to clover at all.

### Key Identifying Characteristics

**Overall Appearance:**
- **Small, low-growing herbaceous plant**
- 2-6 inches tall (occasionally to 12 inches)
- Delicate, almost fairy-like appearance
- Forms small patches or scattered individual plants
- Can grow in various light conditions

**Leaves:**
- **Three heart-shaped leaflets** (trifoliate)
- Each leaflet is 1/4 to 1 inch wide
- **Folded along the midrib** (creating a "V" shape)
- Bright to medium green (sometimes purple-tinged)
- **Clover-like appearance** but heart-shaped (not rounded)
- **Leaflets close at night or in bright sun** (like sleep!)
- Arranged on long, slender stems

**Stems:**
- Thin, delicate, pale green or reddish
- Slightly hairy (tiny hairs)
- **Taste: INTENSELY TART and LEMONY** (key identifier!)

**Flowers:**
- **Yellow, white, or pink** depending on species
- 5 petals
- Small (1/4 to 1/2 inch across)
- Delicate, cup-shaped
- **Striped or veined** (often with darker lines)
- Bloom spring through fall

**Seed Pods:**
- **Cylindrical, pointed pods** (like tiny okra)
- Stand upright on stems
- **Explosively dehisce** (pop open and fling seeds)
- Fun to touch when ripe!

**Roots:**
- Small, fibrous roots
- Some species have small bulblets or rhizomes

### Common Pacific Northwest Species

**Oregon Oxalis / Redwood Sorrel** (*Oxalis oregana*):
- **Native PNW species**
- White to pink flowers
- Larger leaves (up to 1.5 inches)
- Forest floor of coastal forests
- Most common in deep shade

**Yellow Wood Sorrel** (*Oxalis stricta* or *O. corniculata*):
- **Introduced (non-native) but widespread**
- **Yellow flowers**
- Smaller overall
- Grows in disturbed areas, gardens, lawns
- More sun-tolerant

**All Oxalis species in the PNW are edible** (with moderation—see safety notes).

## Look-Alikes: Mostly Clover

### Clover (*Trifolium* species)

The most common confusion:

**Differences:**
- Clover leaflets are **rounded or oval** (not heart-shaped)
- Clover has **round flower heads** (pom-pom like)
- Clover tastes sweet or bland (NOT lemony-tart)
- Clover is in the legume family (wood sorrel is not)

**Clover is also edible**, so confusing them isn't dangerous!

**The taste test is foolproof:**
- **Wood sorrel = Intensely sour, lemony**
- **Clover = Mild, slightly sweet**

### Shamrock / Black Medic

Other three-leaved plants:

- **Shamrock** (*Trifolium* species): Similar to clover
- **Black Medic** (*Medicago lupulina*): Tiny yellow flowers, rounded leaflets
- **Both are edible** but don't have wood sorrel's flavor

**Bottom line:** The three-parted leaves might cause confusion, but the **lemony taste of wood sorrel is unmistakable**. If it tastes like lemon candy, it's wood sorrel!

## Season & Habitat

### When to Forage

**Year-Round Availability in Mild Climates!**

In the Pacific Northwest's mild winters:

- **Spring (March-May)**: Most tender, abundant, flavorful
- **Summer (June-August)**: Good, but flowers and sets seed
- **Fall (September-November)**: Excellent again
- **Winter (December-February)**: Slows but still available in mild areas

**Best for harvesting:**
- **Spring**: Young, tender leaves
- Before flowering (most tender)
- Cool weather brings out the best flavor

### Where It Grows

Wood sorrel is **incredibly versatile** and grows in many habitats:

**Forest Floors** (Oregon Oxalis):
- Deep shade under conifers
- Coast Range and Cascade forests
- Redwood and Douglas fir understory
- Moist, rich soil
- Often forms extensive carpets

**Disturbed Areas** (Yellow Wood Sorrel):
- Gardens and lawns (considered a "weed")
- Path edges and clearings
- Flower beds and landscaping
- Cracks in pavement
- Urban areas

**Habitat Preferences:**
- Moist soil (not waterlogged)
- Shade to partial sun (varies by species)
- Rich, slightly acidic soil
- Cool temperatures

**Elevation:**
- Sea level to mid-elevations
- More abundant at lower elevations

## Specific Foraging Locations

### Washington

**Forest Habitat (Oregon Oxalis):**
- Olympic National Park and Forest (deep forest floors)
- Mount Rainier lower elevation trails
- Coastal forests throughout Washington
- Any mature forest with moist soil

**Urban Areas (Yellow Wood Sorrel):**
- City parks and gardens throughout Puget Sound
- Your own backyard (if you have it!)
- Sidewalk cracks in Seattle
- Literally everywhere

### Oregon

**Forest Habitat (Oregon Oxalis):**
- Forest Park, Portland
- Silver Falls State Park
- Coastal forests from Astoria south
- Redwood forests in southern Oregon (where it gets the name "redwood sorrel")

**Urban Areas (Yellow Wood Sorrel):**
- Gardens and parks throughout Oregon
- Portland urban areas
- Willamette Valley towns
- Common in lawns and landscaping

### Urban Foraging

Wood sorrel is **perfect for urban foraging**:

- Grows in gardens, parks, lawns
- Often considered a weed (gardeners pull it out)
- Ask neighbors if you can forage from their gardens!
- Very accessible

**Urban Safety:**
- Avoid areas sprayed with herbicides
- Don't pick from dog-walking areas
- Rinse thoroughly
- Best from chemical-free gardens

## Harvesting Tips

### How to Harvest

**Leaf and Flower Method:**
- **Pinch off leaves and flowers** at the stem
- Take only what you need
- Leave roots and lower portions
- Plants will regrow

**Whole Plant (Small-Scale):**
- For yellow wood sorrel (considered invasive), you can pull entire plants
- For native Oregon oxalis, be more respectful—just take leaves

**Sustainable Harvesting:**
- Wood sorrel is common and regrows quickly
- Take leaves from multiple plants
- Don't denude an entire patch
- Leave flowers to set seed

**Cleaning:**
- Rinse gently in cold water
- Pat dry
- Inspect for dirt or insects

## Oxalic Acid: Important Safety Information

### What Is Oxalic Acid?

Wood sorrel contains **oxalic acid**—the compound that gives it the tart flavor. Oxalic acid is also found in:
- Spinach
- Rhubarb leaves (high levels—toxic)
- Beet greens
- Swiss chard
- Tea

### Is It Dangerous?

**In moderation, wood sorrel is perfectly safe.**

**Oxalic acid can:**
- Bind with calcium, reducing absorption
- Contribute to kidney stones in susceptible individuals
- Be problematic in very large quantities

### Safe Consumption Guidelines

**Safe amounts:**
- **Use as a flavoring, not a main vegetable**
- A handful of leaves in a salad: Fine
- A garnish or trail snack: Fine
- Eating large amounts daily: Not recommended

**Who should be cautious:**
- People with kidney stones or kidney problems
- Those with gout
- Pregnant women (in excess)
- People with calcium deficiency

**Cooking reduces oxalic acid:**
- Boiling or steaming reduces levels
- Discard cooking water

**Bottom line:** Wood sorrel is safe when eaten in moderation as a flavoring or accent, not as a staple vegetable.

## Culinary Uses
