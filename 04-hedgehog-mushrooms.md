# Chapter 4: Hedgehog Mushrooms (*Hydnum* species)

## The Foolproof Forager's Friend

If you're nervous about mushroom identification, the hedgehog mushroom should be at the top of your list. Often called the "sweet tooth," this delicious edible has **no poisonous look-alikes** in the Pacific Northwest, making it one of the safest wild mushrooms you can forage. Combined with its excellent flavor and the fact that it fruits alongside chanterelles, the hedgehog is a must-know mushroom for PNW foragers.

The hedgehog gets its common name from the soft, tooth-like spines on the underside of its cap—a unique feature that makes identification simple and certain.

## Identification: The Tooth Test

Hedgehogs are unmistakable once you know what to look for. Those distinctive teeth are the giveaway.

### Key Identifying Characteristics

**Cap:**
- 2-6 inches across (sometimes larger)
- Convex (rounded) when young, becoming flatter or even depressed (sunken) in the center with age
- Irregular, wavy edges
- Color: cream, pale orange, peachy-salmon, or light tan
- **Surface texture**: Smooth to slightly velvety, never slimy
- Often looks like soft suede leather
- May have cracks or scales in dry conditions

**Spines/Teeth (The Key Feature!):**
- **Soft, brittle spines** on the underside of the cap (instead of gills)
- Look like tiny icicles or hedgehog quills
- 1/8 to 1/4 inch long
- Same color as cap or slightly paler
- **Run down the stem** (decurrent)
- Easily brushed off with your finger
- No other common PNW mushroom has this feature!

**Stem:**
- 1-4 inches tall
- Same color as cap or paler
- Thick and solid
- Central or slightly off-center
- Smooth surface
- Often swollen at the base

**Flesh:**
- White to pale cream
- Firm and solid (especially when young)
- Brittle—breaks cleanly rather than bending
- Does not change color when cut

**Spore Print:**
- White

**Smell:**
- Mild, pleasant, slightly fruity or nutty
- Not distinctive

## Species in the Pacific Northwest

**Common Hedgehog** (*Hydnum repandum*):
- Most common species
- Peachy-cream to light orange color
- The classic hedgehog

**Belly Button Hedgehog** (*Hydnum umbilicatum*):
- Smaller (1-3 inches)
- Darker orange-brown
- Deep depression in center of cap (like a belly button)
- Same edibility

**White Hedgehog** (*Hydnum albidum*):
- Pale cream to white
- Otherwise similar to common hedgehog
- Equally edible and delicious

All hedgehog species in the PNW are edible and delicious!

## Look-Alikes: None That Matter!

This is what makes hedgehogs so perfect for beginners: **there are no poisonous look-alikes in the Pacific Northwest.**

### Other Toothed Mushrooms (All Safe)

**Spreading Hedgehog** (*Hydnum albomagnum*):
- Larger, whiter
- Still edible
- Less common

**Scaly Hedgehog** (*Sarcodon* species):
- Darker brown with scales on cap
- Edible but bitter (not choice)
- Spines are darker, more gray

**Hawk's Wing** (*Sarcodon imbricatus*):
- Large brown mushroom with scales
- Bitter taste makes it undesirable

**The key**: If it has soft spines/teeth under the cap, it's some kind of toothed mushroom. In the PNW, none of them are poisonous. Hedgehogs (*Hydnum* species) are the best tasting.

## Season & Habitat

### When to Hunt

**Peak Season**: October through December

Hedgehog mushrooms fruit in the fall, overlapping with chanterelle season:
- **Early season**: September-October
- **Peak**: November
- **Late season**: December-January (on the coast)

**Best conditions:**
- After fall rains
- Cool temperatures (40-60°F)
- Consistent moisture but not waterlogged soil

### Where They Grow

Hedgehogs are mycorrhizal mushrooms that partner with conifer trees. They share similar habitat with chanterelles.

**Forest Types:**
- Douglas fir forests
- Western hemlock stands
- Sitka spruce (coastal areas)
- Mixed conifer forests
- Occasionally in hardwood/conifer mixes

**Specific Conditions:**
- Mature second-growth forests
- Mossy forest floor
- Well-drained soil with thick duff layer
- North-facing slopes
- Under salal and sword fern
- Sometimes hidden under moss or duff

**Terrain:**
- Level to gently sloping areas
- Around nurse logs
- Not usually on steep slopes

**Elevation:**
- Sea level to mid-elevations (up to 3,000 feet)
- More common at lower elevations than chanterelles

## Specific Foraging Locations

### Washington

**Olympic Peninsula**
- Olympic National Forest
- Coastal forests near the Hoh and Quinault
- Lower elevation trails throughout the peninsula

**Cascade Foothills**
- Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest
- Gifford Pinchot National Forest
- Areas around Mount Rainier (lower elevation trails)

**Coast**
- Long Beach Peninsula
- Willapa Hills
- Any coastal conifer forest

### Oregon

**Coast Range**
- Tillamook State Forest
- Siuslaw National Forest
- Saddle Mountain area
- Kings Mountain Trail

**Cascade Range**
- Mount Hood National Forest (lower elevations)
- Willamette National Forest
- Areas west of the Cascade crest

**Specific Trails:**
- Any trail where you'd find chanterelles
- Check the same areas—hedgehogs often grow nearby

### Finding Hedgehogs

**Tips:**
- Look in the same areas as chanterelles (they're often together)
- Hedgehogs blend in with forest duff—look carefully!
- Sometimes hidden under moss or leaves
- Often grow in scattered groups rather than dense patches
- Their peachy-tan color makes them less visible than golden chanterelles

## Harvesting Tips

### Cutting Method

- **Cut at the base** with a sharp knife
- Trim off the dirty stem end in the field
- Leave the underground mycelium intact

Some foragers twist and pull, but cutting is gentler on the ecosystem.

### Sustainable Practices

- **Leave small buttons**: Let them mature and release spores
- **Take no more than half**: Leave plenty for wildlife and spore production
- **Harvest selectively**: Don't take every mushroom in a patch
- **Return annually**: Hedgehogs fruit in the same areas year after year

### Cleaning in the Field

- Brush off debris and forest duff
- Trim the stem end
- **Spines fall off easily**: Don't worry if some spines drop during collection—this is normal
- Use a mesh bag for spore dispersal

### Age and Quality

**Best eating:**
- Young to medium age hedgehogs
- Firm, solid flesh
- Caps 2-4 inches wide

**Avoid:**
- Very large, old specimens (may be tough or wormy)
- Water-logged mushrooms (soft, squishy)
- Heavily bug-damaged specimens

## Culinary Uses

### Flavor Profile

Hedgehog mushrooms are choice edibles with:
- **Nutty, slightly peppery flavor** (similar to chanterelles but milder)
- Firm, meaty texture when young
- **Slight bitterness** if overcooked or if older specimens
- Absorbs flavors well in cooking

Some people find hedgehogs superior to chanterelles; others prefer them equally.

### Preparation

**Cleaning:**
- **The spines will fall off during cleaning**—this is normal and unavoidable
- Brush off remaining forest debris
- Wipe with a damp cloth
- Don't soak (they absorb water)
- The fallen spines are edible—just part of the mushroom

**Avoiding Bitterness:**
- Use younger, fresher specimens
- Don't overcook
- Blanch briefly if they taste bitter raw (discarding blanching water removes some bitterness)
- Pair with cream or fat to mellow any bitterness

**Cooking Methods:**
- **Sauté**: Classic preparation with butter and garlic
- **Dry sauté first**: Cook over medium heat until they release moisture, then add butter
- **Cream sauce**: Their flavor shines in cream-based dishes
- **Soup**: Excellent in mushroom soups and bisques
- **Pickle**: Their firm texture holds up well to pickling

### Recipe Ideas

- Hedgehog mushroom cream sauce over pasta
- Hedgehog and potato soup
- Sautéed hedgehogs on toast
- Hedgehog risotto
- Mixed mushroom medley (combine with chanterelles)
- Mushroom gravy with hedgehogs

### Pairing Suggestions

Hedgehogs pair beautifully with:
- Butter, cream, and cheese
- Fresh herbs (thyme, parsley, sage)
- Garlic and shallots
- White wine
- Potatoes and root vegetables
- Game meats and poultry

### Preservation

**Drying** (Excellent Method):
- Slice into pieces
- Dehydrate at 110-125°F
- Store in airtight containers
- Rehydrate in warm water or broth
- Dried hedgehogs have concentrated, nutty flavor

**Freezing:**
- Sauté first, then freeze in portions
- Or blanch briefly, drain, and freeze
- Use within 6 months
- Texture may soften but flavor remains

**Pickling:**
- Their firm texture makes them excellent for pickling
- Blanch briefly, then pickle in vinegar brine
- Great on charcuterie boards

## Storage

- **Fresh**: Paper bag in refrigerator, 5-7 days
- **Dried**: Airtight container, up to 1 year
- **Frozen**: Use within 6 months

## Fun Facts

- The scientific name *Hydnum repandum* comes from the Greek *hydnon* meaning "truffle" (which also had tooth-like features)
- In some European countries, hedgehogs are considered equal to or better than chanterelles
- They're called "pied de mouton" (sheep's foot) in France
- Hedgehogs are sold commercially in European markets but less common in North America
- The soft spines are a unique evolutionary adaptation for spore dispersal

## Medicinal & Nutritional Properties

Hedgehog mushrooms contain:
- Beneficial polysaccharides
- Antioxidants
- Protein and B vitamins
- Minerals including selenium and potassium
- Low in calories and fat

Research suggests potential immune-boosting and anti-inflammatory properties.

## Why Hedgehogs Are Perfect for Beginners

Let's recap why hedgehogs should be on every new forager's list:

1. **No poisonous look-alikes** in the PNW
2. **Distinctive spines** make identification foolproof
3. **Fruits in the same areas as chanterelles** (you can find both on the same trip)
4. **Delicious flavor** comparable to chanterelles
5. **Firm texture** holds up well in cooking
6. **Easy to preserve** (drying works excellently)
7. **Common and widespread** in PNW forests

## The Hedgehog-Chanterelle Connection

Since hedgehogs and chanterelles share similar habitat and season, many foragers hunt for both simultaneously:

**Similarities:**
- Mycorrhizal with conifers
- Fall fruiting season
- Prefer Douglas fir and hemlock forests
- Similar elevation ranges
- Both "foolproof" for beginners

**Differences:**
- Hedgehogs are slightly less visible (more camouflaged)
- Hedgehogs may fruit slightly later in the season
- Chanterelles are more abundant commercially
- Hedgehogs are more forgiving of cooking mistakes

**Pro tip**: When you find a good chanterelle patch, search the area for hedgehogs. They're often nearby but easier to overlook.
